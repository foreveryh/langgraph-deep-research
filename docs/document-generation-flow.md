## Architecture and Design Principles

### LangGraph State Management

The system utilizes LangGraph's sophisticated state management capabilities to maintain context across multiple execution phases. The state schema is designed to support:

```python
class OverallState(TypedDict, total=False):
    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], add_messages]
    user_query: str
    plan: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    current_task_pointer: int
    query_list: List[str]
    web_research_result: List[str]
    task_specific_results: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    ledger: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    final_report_markdown: str
    # ... additional state fields
```

This design ensures that:
- **State persistence**: Critical information is maintained across node transitions

    enc = tiktoken.get_encoding(encoding_name)
    batches = []
    current_batch = []
    current_tokens = 0
    
    for text in texts:
        tokens = len(enc.encode(text))
        if current_tokens + tokens > max_tokens and current_batch:
            batches.append(current_batch)
            current_batch = [text]
            current_tokens = tokens
        else:
            current_batch.append(text)
            current_tokens += tokens
    
    if current_batch:
        batches.append(current_batch)
    return batches
```

This approach:

  "array_field": ["item1", "item2"]
}
```

This ensures:
- **Consistent Data Exchange**: Reliable interfaces between nodes

# Research synthesis benefits from focused, factual output
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=model, temperature=0.3)

# Document writing balances creativity with accuracy
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=model, temperature=0.7)
```

#### Retry and Error Handling

All LLM interactions include robust error handling:
```python
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
    model=model,
    temperature=temperature,
    max_retries=2,
    api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY"),
)
```

## Error Handling and Resilience

## Batch Generation Mechanism

### Technical Implementation

The batch generation system represents a sophisticated solution to the challenge of processing large volumes of research content within LLM context limits.

#### Token-Based Partitioning

The system uses tiktoken for accurate token counting:
```python
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
tokens = len(enc.encode(text))
```

This ensures:
- **Accurate Measurement**: Precise token counting matches LLM tokenization
- **Optimal Utilization**: Batches approach but don't exceed context limits
- **Content Preservation**: Natural text boundaries are respected

#### Batch Continuity Strategy

Each batch after the first includes context from previous batches:
```python
if previous_content:
    section_prompt += f"""
    Previously generated content for this section:
    {previous_content}
    Continue from the above, ensuring logical flow and no repetition.
    """
```

This approach:
- **Maintains Coherence**: Each batch builds naturally on previous content
- **Prevents Redundancy**: Explicit instructions prevent content duplication
- **Ensures Completeness**: All source material is addressed across batches

#### Final Integration Process

The last batch in each section includes special instructions:
```python
if is_last:
    section_prompt += "At the end of this batch, write a summary paragraph for the section."
else:
    section_prompt += "Do not write a conclusion; just continue the section."
```
