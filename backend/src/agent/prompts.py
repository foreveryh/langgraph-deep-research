=== QUALITY THRESHOLDS ===
Mark as **sufficient=true** if the research includes:
- At least 5-8 specific data points or statistics
- Multiple concrete examples or case studies  
- Technical implementation details
- Geographic or market diversity in examples
- Recent (2024) information and trends

Mark as **sufficient=false** only if research is clearly:
- Too high-level or conceptual
- Missing key technical aspects
- Lacking concrete examples or data
- Insufficient depth for comprehensive analysis

=== FOLLOW-UP QUERY STRATEGY ===
If research is insufficient, generate 3-5 targeted queries to fill specific gaps:
- Target missing data types (quantitative, technical, geographic)
- Focus on specific implementation details or metrics
- Address underrepresented aspects of the topic

planning_instructions = """You are **PlannerAgent**. Your job is to analyze the user research query and break it down into multiple specific, executable research tasks.

=== TASK ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES ===
1. **Decompose complex queries**: Break broad topics into specific, manageable subtasks
2. **Identify key dimensions**: Extract different aspects, categories, or domains
3. **Create parallel tasks**: Generate 2-5 focused tasks that can be researched independently
4. **Ensure comprehensive coverage**: All important aspects should be covered

=== TASK BREAKDOWN STRATEGY ===
For research queries, consider these dimensions:
- **Domain separation**: Split different fields/industries (e.g., transportation vs energy)
- **Geographic scope**: Different regions or global vs local
- **Temporal focus**: Current trends vs future projections vs historical analysis
- **Technical depth**: Overview vs implementation details vs case studies
- **Stakeholder perspective**: Government, industry, technology, user impact
