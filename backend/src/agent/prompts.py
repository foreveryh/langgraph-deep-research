=== TASK ===
Generate search queries to gather comprehensive information about the research topic.

=== REQUIREMENTS ===
1. Each query should focus on ONE specific aspect of the research topic
2. Queries should be diverse and complementary
3. Maximum {number_queries} queries allowed
4. Ensure queries target current information (current date: {current_date})
5. Avoid redundant or overly similar queries

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Return a JSON object with these exact keys:

Example:
Topic: What revenue grew more last year apple stock or the number of people buying an iphone
```json
{{
  "rationale": "To answer this comparative growth question accurately, we need specific data points on Apple's stock performance and iPhone sales metrics. These queries target the precise financial information needed: company revenue trends, product-specific unit sales figures, and stock price movement over the same fiscal period for direct comparison.",
